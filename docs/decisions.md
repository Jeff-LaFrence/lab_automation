# Decisions

One line per decision where SPEC.md was silent, where it was wrong about a
library, or where a fallback was taken. Open problems are at the end.

## Environment and process

- The build machine runs Python 3.12. SPEC.md was checked on 3.13. Everything installs and runs on 3.12, which is also the CI version.
- The first commit on `main` holds only SPEC.md, CLAUDE.md, and `.gitignore`, so it predates `labauto demo`. Every merge after it passes `pytest -q` and `labauto demo`.
- The whole build ran unattended. No question was put to the owner, so each choice below was taken without review.
- ruff ignores E501 (line length): the formatter already wraps code, and the remaining long lines are message strings.
- ruff skips Markdown files. ruff 0.17 formats Python code blocks inside Markdown, and once rewrote two code blocks in SPEC.md. The file was restored from git.

## Stage 1

- `OT_API_CONFIG_DIR` works as SPEC.md says. Setting it to `.labauto/opentrons` before the first import keeps the library's config files out of the home folder.
- In process simulation does not leak state between runs in the test suite (`test_repeated_simulations_do_not_leak_state`), so there is no subprocess per simulation.
- The simulator's exception text carries Python tracebacks with absolute paths. The message kept in a `SIM_*` error is the simulator's top level `detail` text, with any absolute path replaced by `<path>`.
- Error mapping checks substrings in a fixed order. The unknown labware message also contains `KeyError`, so `FileNotFoundError` is checked before the `SIM_OTHER` fallback.
- `needs_human` for simulator and ledger errors: true for `SIM_DECK_CONFLICT`, `SIM_LABWARE_NOT_FOUND`, `SIM_OTHER`, and `LEDGER_MISMATCH` (no design change fixes them), false for `SIM_OUT_OF_TIPS` and `SIM_BAD_VOLUME`.
- Added fields: `PlanError.short` (a compact detail for tables), `LedgerEntry.dest_labware`, `CheckResult.input_kind`, `CheckResult.instrument`, `CheckResult.layer_status`, and `Worklist.workcell_id`, `Worklist.plan_id`, `Worklist.tips_needed`.
- Added error code `UNKNOWN_INSTRUMENT` (workcell layer, `needs_human` true) for a workcell whose instrument string has no backend.
- A pipette model the backend cannot map, a tip rack or plate missing from the deck, and an inventory well that its labware does not have are all reported as `UNKNOWN_LABWARE`.
- Both `grid` and `conditions` set fails parsing with `SCHEMA_INVALID`. Neither set is `EMPTY_DESIGN`.
- The Design model forbids unknown fields, so a misspelled field such as `replicate` fails with `SCHEMA_INVALID` instead of quietly taking the default.
- A design whose `assay_id` names a different assay fails with `SCHEMA_INVALID` at `assay_id`. A design's `workcell_id` is a note only, so one design file can run on any workcell.
- The same value listed twice in one grid list is reported as `DUPLICATE_CONDITION`.
- `VOLUME_OUT_OF_RANGE` groups rows by reagent and volume and lists the wells, to keep the error list short.
- The plan rules do not compare `totals_ul` with the wells. The ledger check compares the simulator's totals with `totals_ul`, which catches a stale total.
- A design with no id gets `d-` plus the first 12 hex characters of its hash. A plan id follows its design id (`d-...` becomes `p-...`), so the same design gives the same plan on every workcell.
- A grid expands in the assay's factor order, so condition 0 takes the first listed value of every factor.
- The negative control has `conditions: null` in the plan, as in the SPEC.md example. The reference control carries its conditions.
- `summary.md` uses Markdown headings for its sections, lists reagent use with the most used reagent (as a share of usable volume) first, and prints both hashes in full.
- Run folder names end in four random hex characters. This is a name, not an experimental choice, so it is not seeded.
- `labauto demo` writes its run folders under `runs/`, which is gitignored.
